### A Perzonalid Echo - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/bash-tutorials---a-personalized-echo

# Write a Bash script which accepts  as input and displays a greeting: "Welcome (name)"

# A Quick Introduction to 'Echo'

# This is the equivalent of common output commands in most programming language (print or puts statements).

# For Example:

# echo "Greetings"
# This outputs just one word "Greetings" (without the quotation marks).

# echo "Greetings $USER, your current working directory is $PWD"
# This picks up the values of the environment variables  and  and displays something like:

# Greetings prashantb1984, your current working directory is /home/prashantb1984  
# The above message, of course, will vary from system to system, depending on the setting of environment variables.

# Accepting Inputs

# his can be accomplished using the read statement.

# read number
# echo "The number you have entered is $number"  
# If the user provides an input 4, the output is:

# The number you have entered is 4  
# Consider this snippet:

# read name
# echo "The name you have entered is $name"  
# If the user provides an input Max, the output is:

# The name you have entered is Max 

read name 

echo "Welcome $name"
